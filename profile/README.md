ORGAN-III is the commercial organ of the [organvm system](https://github.com/meta-organvm). Where ORGAN-I theorizes and ORGAN-II creates, ORGAN-III ships. Every repository here represents a product — deployed or in development — that generates revenue, serves customers, or solves real operational problems. These are SaaS platforms, B2B tools, B2C applications, and internal utilities built to sustain the entire eight-organ ecosystem.

The products span public records data extraction, perpetual futures trading, livestream production infrastructure, AI-assisted productivity tools, educational gaming, luxury real estate marketplaces, and more. Each is documented to portfolio standard: architecture decisions, deployment configurations, and revenue models are explicit, not implied.

## Position in the Eight-Organ System

ORGAN-III receives creative and conceptual output from ORGAN-II (Poiesis — Art) and transforms it into deployable products. Those products are then packaged by ORGAN-IV (Taxis — Orchestration) for governance and routing, surfaced by ORGAN-V (Logos — Public Process) for transparent development narratives, and distributed by ORGAN-VII (Kerygma — Marketing). The flow is unidirectional: **Theory → Art → Commerce**. ORGAN-III never depends upstream on its own consumers.

The organvm system spans 81 repositories across 8 organizations, ~320K words of documentation, and 16 published essays.

| Organ | Domain | Organization |
|:------|:-------|:-------------|
| I | Theory | [organvm-i-theoria](https://github.com/organvm-i-theoria) |
| II | Art | [organvm-ii-poiesis](https://github.com/organvm-ii-poiesis) |
| **III** | **Commerce** | **[organvm-iii-ergon](https://github.com/organvm-iii-ergon)** |
| IV | Orchestration | [organvm-iv-taxis](https://github.com/organvm-iv-taxis) |
| V | Public Process | [organvm-v-logos](https://github.com/organvm-v-logos) |
| VI | Community | [organvm-vi-koinonia](https://github.com/organvm-vi-koinonia) |
| VII | Marketing | [organvm-vii-kerygma](https://github.com/organvm-vii-kerygma) |
| VIII | Meta | [meta-organvm](https://github.com/meta-organvm) |
